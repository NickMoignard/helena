    <p>> Narrative Nº 1</p>
    <p>Surrounded by unfamiliarity, you find yourself hauled against an alternate way of life. You begin from zero, again.
You look above you, breathe. The air is clear. New connections are forged in the household.
Choosing to embrace them compels you to feel a sense of gratitude. But you seem to be at odds with those around you. Despite your hopeful attempts to assimilate, language hinders your progress. Your thoughts and intentions are bound. You choose to keep them bound. Yet you know that to feel normal, something must be done.
So, you assemble and venture out on your own. You catch the glances of those in passing. You recognise pity.
Home is a place that feels remote. You’re home now, but you are not cherished.
You choose to stay, even when you know that home is not a place of comfort. The walls close in while you drift further away from your aspirations. It is difficult, I know. This story concludes here, but your story continues. I believe in you.</p>
<p>> Narrative Nº 58</p>
<p>Surrounded by unfamiliarity, you find yourself hauled against an alternate way of life. You begin from zero, again.
The home that you used to know feels like a distant reality. You struggle to comprehend the new relations that have emerged.
You despise them for the enforced compliance, and for circumstances in which you have never been placed before.
You indulge in the idea of removing yourself from this foreign territory. You do not want to comply, yet the ramifications of a rebellion would cost you far too much. Are you sure?
What do you want to do?
The revelation of that inner chaos feels cathartic and unreal. Yet, reality finds its way back to you, and compels you to be... a caretaker.
You care for those who arrived before, and those who came after. It is a routine to which you have become accustomed.
Layers and layers disappear as you surrender your time and possessions. But so long as your core remains, you remain.
What will be left of you if everything is given away? The solution is not always revealed through kindness and compassion.
But remember, at the end of the day, you will still have you, and I will be here, too.</p>
